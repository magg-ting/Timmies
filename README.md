## About
This is a college project to create a micro website (with homepage, about page, product page and contact page) for Tim Hortons.  
The objective is to style responsive webpages with pure CSS, so frameworks such as Bootstrap and Tailwind are not used here.

## Developers  
Magg - Homepage (incl. wireframe design, navbar and footer), and reviewing HTML semantics on all pages  
Pio - Menu page  
Ruben - About page  
Eduardo - Contact page 

## Copyright
All images belong to Tim Hortons and are used in the project for educational purposes only.
